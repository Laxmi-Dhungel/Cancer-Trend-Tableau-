# Cancer deaths Trend (1990-2016) (Tableau)
In this repository, I have utilized tableau to understand the trend of cancer related deaths across the world over the years 1990-2016. The data for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antimoni/cancer-deaths-by-country-and-type-1990-2016?resource=download). 
In this project, I have made a dashboard which includes total number of cancer related deaths, total cancer related deaths for each country, top 10 countries for cancer related deaths, total cancer related deaths for each year and the most common cancer causing deaths. This dashboard is interactive and can be used to determine the total cancer deaths and most common type of cancer for different countries, years or both combined. 

The countries columns contained regions such as world, Western Europe, etc. The unrecognized countries were filtered out during the data analysis. There were total 190,838,396 cancer related deaths. The highest number of cancer related deaths occured in China. There were 27 countries that had >=1 million cancer related deaths. An increase trend in cancer related deaths was observed over the years (1990-2016). The trachea, bronchus and lung cancer caused the highest number of total deaths in the world. 

This dashboard can be found at tableau public (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/laxmi.dhungel/viz/cancer_deaths_trend/Cancerrelateddeathstrend#1).


The screenshot of the dashboard showing the cancer death trend is shown below:
