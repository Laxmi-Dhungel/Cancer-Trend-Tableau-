# Cancer deaths Trend (1990-2016) (Tableau)
In this repository, I have utilized tableau to understand the trend of cancer related deaths across the world over the years 1990-2016. The data for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antimoni/cancer-deaths-by-country-and-type-1990-2016?resource=download). 
In this project, I have made a dashboard which includes total number of cancer related deaths, total cancer related deaths for each country, top 10 countries for cancer related deaths, total cancer related deaths for each year and the most common cancer causing deaths. This dashboard is interactive and can be used to determine the total cancer deaths and most common type of cancer for different countries, years or both combined. 

This dashboard can be found at tableau public (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/laxmi.dhungel/viz/cancer_deaths_trend/Cancerrelateddeathstrend#1).
